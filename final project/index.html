  <p>The Christmas tree is one of the most important staples of the holidays, from everyday homes to the Rockefeller Center in New York. But, before they are cut, taken home and decorated in colorful lights and baubles, where are they grown?</p>
  <p>Do you know where your Christmas tree came come from?</p>

  <p><a href=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Census_of_Horticulture_Specialties/index.php style="color:blue">The 2019 Census of Horticultural Specialties</a> found that the inventory of Christmas trees produced in the United States in 2020 was 118 million. Out of 50 states, Oregon produced the most trees at 4.4 million, followed by North Carolina at 2.5 million.</p>

<p>However, reports about disruptions in the supply chain this year due to pandemic-related causes worry some people. <a href=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/christmas-tree-shortage-because-of-supply-chain-issues-climate-change.html style="color:blue">CNBC reported back in November</a> that both the supply chain issues and climate change have caused a shortage in Christmas trees – both real and otherwise.</p>

<p>What does this mean for people looking to get a tree? Would they be able to get one, if they haven’t yet?

<p>Doug Hundley, from the <a href=https://realchristmastrees.org style="color:blue">National Christmas Tree Association</a>, says that the total number of trees sold this year is yet to be known but they expect it to be equal to that of 2020 as demand is “very good” and the supply “is available to meet it.”</p>

<p>“The current supply chain issues in 2021, we do not think has hampered the deliver of real Christmas trees this year,” he said. “Although higher shipping prices is likely affecting the retail prices of real Christmas trees.”</p>
